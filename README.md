# Carbontrack

Carbontrack calculates the amount of CO2 emitted for a journey. You can then track and compare with friends or family. Work colleagues can create a commuting group or you could simply join a group with other people you know. Or for all those secret green introverts out there the option to ride solo.

The app was built to create awareness for the amount of C02 emissions produced on everyday journeys by car. And provides alternative travel options showing real-time emission savings. Climate change is currently one of the biggest issues facing the planet right now. Hopefully this app can go a small way to increasing awareness around this important topic and getting people involved in the push for better climate action.
